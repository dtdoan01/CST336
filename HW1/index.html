                <p>Data science, in its most basic terms, can be defined as obtaining insights and information, really anything of value, out of data. Like any new field, it's often tempting but counterproductive to try to put concrete bounds on its definition. This is data science. This is not. In reality, data science is evolving so fast and has already shown such enormous range of possibility that a wider definition is essential to understanding it</p>
